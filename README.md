## Differences with Athanasia
While **Athanasia** is not yet deployed anywhere, **Athanasia** is designed to be faster as it is developed to be a single page application. 
**Athanasia** also has the ability to communicate between users while maintaining security around them. This communication is then used to create multi-user applications.
